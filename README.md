My Image Processing Msc Assignment on Matlab 

This is My Msc Image Processing assignment, where we had to use colour detection, segmentation and noise reduction. 

Code uses the simulated images, the real images were used for testing and may not resolve properly.

You will need the image processing toolbox for this to function.
